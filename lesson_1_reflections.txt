>>How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
reduced the candidates for finding errors to the most likely ones (lines that were changed)
easier to focus on the nature of the changes if not necessary to identify the changes themselves first

>>How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
you don't have to be afraid of small changes destroying everything (just undo if they do)
You can always reconstruct what you did and when
no change, error or deletion would have to be permanent

>>What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
pros:
-no unnecessary/meaningless commits
-stay able to reconstruct multiple different important changes even if they were commited within a short time
cons:
-no saving of history when you are to lazy, concentrated or forgetful to commit

>>Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
probaly some systems do not assume that a change in one file may directly affect all other files
for instance several files may be part of a collaborative project, but everybody works on a differetn file
in that case you would want to be able to always track who changed what seperately
if you only have software projects, it is more likely that several files have to be changed together, otherweise they would no function anymore at all
in thoe cases it makes more sense to change all files at once, and track the changes in one step

>>How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log to identify the type of chenge of interest
git diff to identify/understand the exact nature of the change

>>How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
more confidence

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
programming bioinformatic tools

>>What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git will set up some files to store and track commits.
However, it does not create commits yet
You do this to set a starting point and a storage location for your project 

>>How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
is supposed to be a kind of in-between between wd and repo
you can check what you are doing before committing
